This indicates that you forgot a closing quotation mark at the end of a string,
e.g.:

    { someField(someArgument: "abc) }

Alternatively, you might be misusing an escape sequence within the string, causing
the quotation mark to be interpreted as part of the string, not a terminator:

    { someField(someArgument: "abc\") }

Make sure your strings are correctly delimited to address this problem.
