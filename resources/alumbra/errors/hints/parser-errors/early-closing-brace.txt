This means that you closed a block too early and is most commonly caused by an
empty selection set, e.g.:

    { someField { } }

Alternatively, you might see this error after a linebreak within a
non-terminated string since GraphQL does not support multi-line strings:

    {
      someField(someArgument: "a) {
        someSelection
      }
    }
