Variable "${{ alumbra/variable-name }}" has type
"{{ alumbra/type-description|alumbra/graphql-type }}" which is not an input type.
----
This usually means that you're trying to use an OBJECT type for a variable,
where only INPUT types are allowed.

    type {{ alumbra/variable-type-name }} { ... }

Change your declaration to the following to solve this problem:

    input {{ alumbra/variable-type-name }} { ... }

If you need the type for both input and output values, consider creating
an INPUT type alongside, commonly suffixed with "Input":

    type {{ alumbra/variable-type-name }} { ... }
    input {{ alumbra/variable-type-name }}Input { ... }
