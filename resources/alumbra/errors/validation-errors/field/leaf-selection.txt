Field "{{ alumbra/field-name }}" of type "{{ alumbra/containing-type-name }}"
must have a selection of subfields.
----
Fields that provide OBJECT, INTERFACE or UNION types cannot be queried as
leaves. Instead, you have to provide a selection set querying the desired
information. Try the following:

    {{ alumbra/field-name }} { ... }
